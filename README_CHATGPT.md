Codex Prompt: `Explain codebase structure to newcomer`

### General structure

The repository hosts multiple small AI projects organized mainly by domain:

```
The root README.md gives an overview of the main subprojects, listing ConnectX, Knights Isolation, search algorithms and puzzles.

### Games
- ConnectX – Implements various Connect‑4 agents from simple random moves to minimax with alpha‑beta pruning and bitboard representation. The README describes the agents and their leaderboard scores.
- Knights Isolation – Includes adversarial search players and reinforcement learning for a chess‑knight variant.
- Rock‑Paper‑Scissors – Contains simple rule-based bots, statistical models and an LSTM agent in PyTorch. The neural network README explains training procedures and model architecture.

### Search algorithms
- Ant Colony Optimization – Provides a solver for the Travelling Salesman Problem with support for KMeans clustering. The README describes the algorithm and its biological inspiration.
- ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) – A large project with a data model, multiple solvers (rule‑based, geometry, XGBoost, etc.) and tooling to compile a submission script. The README documents installation and the solver architecture.
- Pacman – Coursework from Berkeley’s AI class. The README explains how to run the autograder and complete search exercises.

### Puzzles
- Includes Sudoku solving, cryptarithmetic with z3 constraints, the classic N‑Queens problem in Prolog, and a reverse Game of Life solver. Each folder has a README. For example, the Sudoku README summarizes the puzzle and gives examples of solved grids, while the cryptarithmetic README explains the z3 approach and the Game of Life README outlines reversing the automaton using constraints.

### Reinforcement Learning
- The gymnasium folder contains toy RL experiments for environments like CartPole. Some subprojects have brief docs—for instance the CartPole README lists a link to additional documentation. Example training code is provided, such as a DQN implementation in gymnasium/CartPole/Grok.py.

### Utilities and tooling
- np_cache.py – Decorator for caching NumPy array results in memory.
- kaggle_compile.py – Consolidates multiple Python files into a single script suitable for Kaggle kernels.

### Where to go next
- Run the projects – Many folders contain requirements files or README.md instructions for running notebooks or scripts locally. For example, the Rock‑Paper‑Scissors LSTM README lists steps to install and launch a training loop.

- Explore different algorithms – Study the variety of approaches within each subproject (minimax heuristics, Monte‑Carlo search, neural networks, decision trees, constraint solvers).

- Look at tests – Some projects include unit and integration tests (e.g., ConnectX under games/connectx/tests/). Reviewing these can help you understand expected behavior.

- Experiment with the Kaggle compile script – kaggle_compile.py can bundle multiple source files into a single script for Kaggle competitions.

- Reinforcement learning – The RL samples in gymnasium/ and the Pixelcopter or CartPole agents show basic DQN and Q‑learning implementations that can be adapted or extended.

- Read more specialized references – Several READMEs point to Kaggle notebooks or research notes, which may be worth reading for deeper detail on each solution approach.

Overall, the repository acts as a collection of AI practice projects covering adversarial search, optimization methods, and puzzle solving. Use the READMEs as entry points, experiment with running or modifying the code, and explore the varied algorithms to deepen your understanding.
